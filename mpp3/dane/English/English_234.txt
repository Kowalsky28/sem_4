i freaked out another phrase that native speakers use is good for you and this could be both positive and negative when you say i got promoted and if they say good for you like congratulations and sometimes if you say like i'm leaving this place.

they're like good for you it would be better without you and this is a negative meaning so really listen to the intonation.

if something surprises you you can also say you gotta be kidding me like oh my god.

i cannot believe it you gotta be kidding me to tell somebody to smile and to be happy you can always say cheer up cheer up.

if you want somebody just sound like crying and complaining about something that is not happening you can say come i'm you can do it i?
