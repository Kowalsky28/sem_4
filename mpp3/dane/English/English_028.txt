[43] The human ecosystem concept is based on the human/nature dichotomy and the idea that all species are ecologically dependent on each other, as well as with the abiotic constituents of their biotope.

[44] A smaller unit of size is called a microecosystem.

For example, a microsystem can be a stone and all the life under it.

A macroecosystem might involve a whole ecoregion, with its drainage basin.

[45] Wilderness is generally defined as areas that have not been significantly modified by human activity.
