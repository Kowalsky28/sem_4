The thin layer of gases that envelops the Earth is held in place by gravity.

Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc.

The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude.

The ozone layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the surface.

As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface.
