Animals as a category have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things.

Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists.

They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae.

They are also distinguished from plants, algae, and fungi by lacking cell walls.

With a few exceptions—most notably the two phyla consisting of sponges and placozoans—animals have bodies that are differentiated into tissues.
