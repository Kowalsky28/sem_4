A wide variety of man-made bodies of water are classified as ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy.

Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed.

While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents.

These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.

A river is a natural watercourse,[38] usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river.
