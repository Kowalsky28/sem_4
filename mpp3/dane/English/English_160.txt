[19]:708â€“710; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time.

This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as "connectionism", by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield, Rumelhart and Hinton.

Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.

[19]:25 Machine learning (ML), reorganized as a separate field, started to flourish in the 1990s.

The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature.
