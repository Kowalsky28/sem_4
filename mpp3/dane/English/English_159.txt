[18] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.

[19]:488 However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning.

Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.

[19]:488 By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor.

[20] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming, but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.
