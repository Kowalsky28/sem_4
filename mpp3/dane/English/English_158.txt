A hypothetical algorithm specific to classifying data may use computer vision of moles coupled with supervised learning in order to train it to classify the cancerous moles.

Where as, a machine learning algorithm for stock trading may inform the trader of future potential predictions.

[15] As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence.

In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data.

They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what was then termed "neural networks"; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics.
