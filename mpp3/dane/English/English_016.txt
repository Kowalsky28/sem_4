Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone drastic climate changes in the past, including ice ages.

The climate of a region depends on a number of factors, especially latitude.

A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region.

There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in the northern and southern extremes.

Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane.
