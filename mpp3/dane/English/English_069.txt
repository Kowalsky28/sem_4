[73] Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page.

Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information to an article can be more difficult to detect.

Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the underlying code of an article, or use images disruptively.

[74] Obvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix vandalism is a few minutes.

[75][76] However, some vandalism takes much longer to repair.
