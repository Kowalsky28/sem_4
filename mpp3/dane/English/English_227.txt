if you ask somebody not to be upset not to cry you can say don't take it to heart.

don't take it to heart like seriously don't be so upset don't take it to heart.

another way to ask if you didn't catch a part of a phrase you can say i didn't catch the last word.

i'm sorry.

can you repeat it because i didn't catch the last word if he wants somebody to repeat the whole phrase again.
