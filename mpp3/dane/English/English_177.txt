In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data.

Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning.

In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data.

Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization[48] and various forms of clustering.

[49][50][51] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional.
