The latter is often extended by regularization (mathematics) methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression.

When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel[70]), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.

A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms.

Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases.
