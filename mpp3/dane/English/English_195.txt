Efficient algorithms exist that perform inference and learning.

Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks.

Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.

A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem.

In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s.
