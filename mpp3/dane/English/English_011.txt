[17] Since the Cambrian explosion there have been five distinctly identifiable mass extinctions.

[18] The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals.

Over the past 66Â million years, mammalian life diversified.

[19] Several million years ago, a species of small African ape gained the ability to stand upright.

[15] The subsequent advent of human life, and the development of agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate.
