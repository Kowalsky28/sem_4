Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network.

This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing.

Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.

[68] Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves).

It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning.
