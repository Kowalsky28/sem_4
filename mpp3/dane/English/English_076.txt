Wikipedia's initial anarchy integrated democratic and hierarchical elements over time.

[96][97] An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.

[98] Editors in good standing in the community can run for one of many levels of volunteer stewardship: this begins with "administrator",[99][100] privileged users who can delete pages, prevent articles from being changed in case of vandalism or editorial disputes (setting protective measures on articles), and try to prevent certain people from editing.

Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).

[101][102] Fewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.
