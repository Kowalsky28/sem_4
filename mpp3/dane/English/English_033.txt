Species that were unable to adapt to the changing environment and competition from other life forms became extinct.

However, the fossil record retains evidence of many of these older species.

Current fossil and DNA evidence shows that all existing species can trace a continual ancestry back to the first primitive life forms.

[64] When basic forms of plant life developed the process of photosynthesis the sun's energy could be harvested to create conditions which allowed for more complex life forms.

[65] The resultant oxygen accumulated in the atmosphere and gave rise to the ozone layer.
