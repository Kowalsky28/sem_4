[37] In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning.

In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time.

There are two kinds of time complexity results.

Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time.

Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.
