[55] In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data.

[56] Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text.

Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.

[57] In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity.

This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object, and many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless it has been aggregated appropriately.
