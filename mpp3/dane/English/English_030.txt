[47] Life may also be said to be simply the characteristic state of organisms.

Properties common to terrestrial organisms (plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria) are that they are cellular, carbon-and-water-based with complex organization, having a metabolism, a capacity to grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce.

An entity with these properties is generally considered life.

However, not every definition of life considers all of these properties to be essential.

Human-made analogs of life may also be considered to be life.
