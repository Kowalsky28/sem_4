In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.

[101] In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively.

Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR).

However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators.

The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability.
