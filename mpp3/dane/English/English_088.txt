It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition.

For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.

Translated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles.

[142] Articles available in more than one language may offer "interwiki links", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.

A study published by PLOS One in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world.
