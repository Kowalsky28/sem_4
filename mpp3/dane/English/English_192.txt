Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels.

Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees.

In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making.

In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision making.

Support vector machines (SVMs), also known as support vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression.
