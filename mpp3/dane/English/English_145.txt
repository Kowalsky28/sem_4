In December 2015, John Julius Norwich stated, in a letter published in The Times newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia "at least a dozen times a day", and had never yet caught it out.

He described it as "a work of reference as useful as any in existence", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.

[341][342] Wikipedia has also spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the Wikimedia Foundation.

These other Wikimedia projects include Wiktionary, a dictionary project launched in December 2002,[343] Wikiquote, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched, Wikibooks, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts, Wikimedia Commons, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia, Wikinews, for citizen journalism, and Wikiversity, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.

[344] Another sister project of Wikipedia, Wikispecies, is a catalogue of species.
