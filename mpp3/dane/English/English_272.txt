she would live her life that day two friends came to visit narcissus mother they were mellie and terry the three of them had been friends for ages but terry and ellie had a secret both of them.

were magical beings something that narcisse's mother knew nothing about terry melli oh it's so good to see you it's been very long hasn't it how have you been i have been very good i would have been better if only if only what if only my daughter narcisa was a little more understanding marian told mellie and terry all about narcisa and how she was worried for her she wants to eat bread made of gold what do i do with her well maybe if her dream comes true.

that would be wonderful wouldn't it well no matter i guess in time she will grow to learn let's talk about something else.

now later on mellie and terry waved goodbye to their old friend and went away smiling to each other secretively that night both mother and daughter.

got ready for bed mother i really hope my dream comes true you know oh narcisa the next day as narcisa and her mother were outside in their garden a beautiful.
