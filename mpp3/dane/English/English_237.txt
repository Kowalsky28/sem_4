oh my god.

you rock you rock?

no, you've done an amazing job.

you rock if somebody's not working really well, and you want them to work harder you can say you should go an extra mile which means like work harder you should go an extra mile .

another way to say the very same thing you can say step up your game like work harder work better step up your game.
