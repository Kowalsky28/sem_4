i'm deluged with assignments smart word number two is catch-22 now i'm sure you've heard this word before catch-22 means an impossible situation in which you can't do one thing unless you've done the other and you can't do the other because you haven't done the first have.

i confused you so let me give you some examples a catch-22 situation is when you don't get a job without having work experience.

but you can't get experience until you get a job catch-22 was coined by joseph heller in his famous book of the same name catch-22 when he was describing some contradictory rules that were applicable to soldiers during world war two.

another example of catch-22 is you need a bank loan because you don't have enough.
