i have a rendezvous with my friends this evening or i'm going to rendezvous with my friends tomorrow.

in france earlier rendezvous was used by the army to indicate a meeting place for the troops now there's something slightly exciting and secretive about the word rendezvous even now so while you can use rendezvous for any meeting.

in general but it won't be very appropriate for an official meeting so if you have a date perhaps you can certainly call that a rendezvous smart word number 9 is obtuse obtuse obtuse is an insult you would use it when you're trying to call someone dumb or unintelligen.t or dim-witted now you've heard the word obtuse in geometry obtuse angle and acute angle so an obtuse angle is an angle greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.

and an acute angle is this sharp angle less than 90 degrees so acute as a word is used to denote sharp and therefore also mentally sharp and obtuse is denoting blunt and .therefore also a little slow in the mind so example sentences with obtuse are the man was so obtuse that he gave away his password to a fake caller or the obtuse child.

wasn't able.
