[12] The moon formed roughly 20 million years later.

Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust.

Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere.

Condensing water vapor, most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources.

[13] The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago.
