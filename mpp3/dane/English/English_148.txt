[350] Wikipedia has been widely used as a corpus for linguistic research in computational linguistics, information retrieval and natural language processing.

In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the entity linking problem, which is then called "wikification",[351] and to the related problem of word-sense disambiguation.

[352] Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find "missing" links in Wikipedia.
