[84] For a brief period in Mars' history, it may have also been capable of forming life.

At present though, most of the water remaining on Mars is frozen.

If life exists at all on Mars, it is most likely to be located underground where liquid water can still exist.

But it has been conjectured that Europa, the fourth-largest moon of Jupiter, may possess a sub-surface ocean of liquid water and could potentially host life.
