[35][36][37]  In November 2009, a researcher at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, the project lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.

[38][39] The Wall Street Journal cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.

[40] Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the methodology of the study.

[41] Two years later, in 2011, Wales acknowledged the presence of a slight decline, noting a decrease from "a little more than 36,000 writers" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011.

In the same interview, Wales also claimed the number of editors was "stable and sustainable".
