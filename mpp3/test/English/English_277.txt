what your mistake was come let's feed you something nice from that day onwards.

narcisa changed her ways she struggled at first but slowly and patiently she started to become a lot nicer one day mellie and terry came to meet marian again oh hello you two so tell us marian.

how's narcissism now marian told them both everything that had happened and she's changed so much from that time.

has she i guess she wouldn't want any more gold bread now huh you know.

terry you actually look a little like that angel though what am i seeing how could you be him you two are so nice
