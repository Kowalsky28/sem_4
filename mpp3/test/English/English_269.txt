narcisa would you help me plant these seeds what why would i do that what have i got all that dirt on my lovely fingers worse what if it went onto my face well that was the problem with narcisa.

she thought herself too great to do any work many suitors came to ask for narcissus hand in marriage.

since her beauty was known far and wide but she rejected them all very rudely why did you send those men away yesterday they seemed nice you can't be serious mom one of them.

had such small eyes almost like a bird's and the other had a huge nose i wouldn't want to be near him.

when he sneezed oh oh and the last stop no i don't want to hear any more all i could see was that those men were really nice my dear you must know that beauty.
