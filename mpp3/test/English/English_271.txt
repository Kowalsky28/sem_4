last night well mom it was such an amazing dream you know there was this prince who came up to me.

and said that he wanted to marry me he had come in a golden carriage and he was dressed from top to bottom and gold as well what a silly dream.

and you know the best part of it was when i was in my wedding dress which was of gold too of course everyone was staring at only me narcisa there is nothing amazing about that dream.

it was a very egotistical dream mom you don't know what you're saying that dream has made me realize that i need food much grander than the type i eat here at home bread made of gold.

just think of that poor narcissus mother was so worried about her daughter and how.
