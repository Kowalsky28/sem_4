"[230] Wikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called Wikimedia movement affiliates.

These include Wikimedia chapters (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikim√©dia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the Catalan language community), and user groups.

These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.

The operation of Wikipedia depends on MediaWiki, a custom-made, free and open source wiki software platform written in PHP and built upon the MySQL database system.

[231] The software incorporates programming features such as a macro language, variables, a transclusion system for templates, and URL redirection.
