Igneous intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and crystallize as they intrude.

After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.

Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion.

These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.

Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54Â billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets.
