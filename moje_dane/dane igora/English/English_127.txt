[268] The Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia.

This position has been successfully defended in court.

[269][270] Because Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.

The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.

Obtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a web crawler is discouraged.
