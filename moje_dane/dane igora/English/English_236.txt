i want to continue i'm not tired not of it when somebody is asking you are you sure and you're pretty sure you can say there is no room for that?

there is no room for doubt in america if you want to sms somebody or send them a message you say text to text so i'll text you means i will send you a message through whatsapp or a telegram or messenger of whatever using i'll text you again to cheer somebody up to tell them to not be upset you can say it's not worth it like why are you crying?

it's not worth it.

you're so much better than the problem you are crying about it's not worth your tears.

it's not worth it i personally love the phrase you rock which means you're amazing.
