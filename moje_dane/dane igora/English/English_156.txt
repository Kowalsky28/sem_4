For example topic modeling, dimensionality reduction or meta learning.

[7] As of 2020, deep learning has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning.

[6] The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence.

[8][9] A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification.

[10] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973.
