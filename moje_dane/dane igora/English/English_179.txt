However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features.

An alternative is to discover such features or representations thorough examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.

Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions, and is assumed to be a sparse matrix.

The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately.

[54] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the K-SVD algorithm.
