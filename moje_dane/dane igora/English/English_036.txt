However, some microorganisms are pathogenic and can post health risk to other organisms.

Originally Aristotle divided all living things between plants, which generally do not move fast enough for humans to notice, and animals.

In Linnaeus' system, these became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Plantae) and Animalia.

Since then, it has become clear that the Plantae as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms.

However, these are still often considered plants in many contexts.
