Sanger coined its name[5][6] as a portmanteau of "wiki" and "encyclopedia".

It was initially an English-language encyclopedia, but versions in other languages were quickly developed.

With 6.2 million articles, the English Wikipedia is the largest of the 317 Wikipedia encyclopedias.

Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 55 million articles,[7] attracting 1.7 billion unique visitors per month.

[8][9] Wikipedia has been criticized for its uneven accuracy and for exhibiting systemic bias, including gender bias, with the majority of editors being male.
