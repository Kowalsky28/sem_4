Given the status of the ongoing Holocene extinction, streams play an important corridor role in connecting fragmented habitats and thus in conserving biodiversity.

The study of streams and waterways in general involves many branches of inter-disciplinary natural science and engineering, including hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, fish biology, riparian ecology, and others.

Ecosystems are composed of a variety of biotic and abiotic components that function in an interrelated way.

[41] The structure and composition is determined by various environmental factors that are interrelated.

Variations of these factors will initiate dynamic modifications to the ecosystem.
