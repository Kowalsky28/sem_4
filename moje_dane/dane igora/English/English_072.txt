[81][82] Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as "edit warring".

[83][84] The process is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.

[85] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,[86] conflict based[87] editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,[88] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.

Special interest groups have engaged in edit wars to advance their own political interests.
