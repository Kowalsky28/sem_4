The remainder is believed to consist of 26.8 percent cold dark matter and 68.3 percent dark energy.

[81] The exact arrangement of these components is still unknown and is under intensive investigation by physicists.

The behaviour of matter and energy throughout the observable universe appears to follow well-defined physical laws.

These laws have been employed to produce cosmological models that successfully explain the structure and the evolution of the universe we can observe.

The mathematical expressions of the laws of physics employ a set of twenty physical constants[82] that appear to be static across the observable universe.
