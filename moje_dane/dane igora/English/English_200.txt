[86] Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested.

[87][88] Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature.

While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.

[89] Machine learning approaches in particular can suffer from different data biases.

A machine learning system trained on current customers only may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data.
