Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation.

Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers.

In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age.

All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.

A pond is a body of standing water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake.
