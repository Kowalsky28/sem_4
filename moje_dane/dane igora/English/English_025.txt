Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).

A stream is a flowing body of water with a current, confined within a bed and stream banks.

In the United States, a stream is classified as a watercourse less than 60 feet (18 metres) wide.

Streams are important as conduits in the water cycle, instruments in groundwater recharge, and they serve as corridors for fish and wildlife migration.

The biological habitat in the immediate vicinity of a stream is called a riparian zone.
