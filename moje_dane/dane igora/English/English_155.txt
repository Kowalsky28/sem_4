[6] The discipline of machine learning employs various approaches to teach computers to accomplish tasks where no fully satisfactory algorithm is available.

In cases where vast numbers of potential answers exist, one approach is to label some of the correct answers as valid.

This can then be used as training data for the computer to improve the algorithm(s) it uses to determine correct answers.

For example, to train a system for the task of digital character recognition, the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits has often been used.

[6] Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, depending on the nature of the "signal" or "feedback" available to the learning system: Other approaches have been developed which don't fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system.
