Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs.

[39] An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data.

An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.

[13] Types of supervised learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression.

[40] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range.
