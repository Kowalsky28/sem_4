An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.

[243] Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or IP address ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the MH17 jet incident in July 2014 when it was reported edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.

[247] Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.

[248] According to Andrew Lih, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.

[249] Wikipedia receives between 25,000 and 60,000-page requests per second, depending on the time of the day.
