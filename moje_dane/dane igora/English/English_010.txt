[14] Continents formed, then broke up and reformed as the surface of Earth reshaped over hundreds of millions of years, occasionally combining to make a supercontinent.

Roughly 750 million years ago, the earliest known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart.

The continents later recombined to form Pannotia which broke apart about 540 million years ago, then finally Pangaea, which broke apart about 180 million years ago.

[16] During the Neoproterozoic era, freezing temperatures covered much of the Earth in glaciers and ice sheets.

This hypothesis has been termed the "Snowball Earth", and it is of particular interest as it precedes the Cambrian explosion in which multicellular life forms began to proliferate about 530–540 million years ago.
