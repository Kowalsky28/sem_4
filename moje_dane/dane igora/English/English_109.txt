[211][212] Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to pedophilia and one about lolicon, were not of real children, but said that they constituted "obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children", under the PROTECT Act of 2003.

[213] That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are obscene under American law.

[213] Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.

[214] Wikimedia Foundation spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,[215] saying that Wikipedia did not have "material we would deem to be illegal.

If we did, we would remove it.
