[51][52][53] The number of individual species of life is constantly in some degree of flux, with new species appearing and others ceasing to exist on a continual basis.

[54][55] The total number of species is in rapid decline.

[56][57][58] The origin of life on Earth is not well understood, but it is known to have occurred at least 3.5Â billion years ago,[61][62][63] during the hadean or archean eons on a primordial Earth that had a substantially different environment than is found at present.

[64] These life forms possessed the basic traits of self-replication and inheritable traits.

Once life had appeared, the process of evolution by natural selection resulted in the development of ever-more diverse life forms.
