71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans.

The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited land in the Northern Hemisphere.

Earth has evolved through geological and biological processes that have left traces of the original conditions.

The outer surface is divided into several gradually migrating tectonic plates.

The interior remains active, with a thick layer of plastic mantle and an iron-filled core that generates a magnetic field.
