down in the description box for that and now the secret tip the secret tip to sound fluent is to use not more than one smart word or sentence i know sometimes.

we get very excited because.

we've learnt a whole lot of these smart words and we tend to stuff two three four of them in one sentence that doesn't sound natural.

so one at a time be sure that you're pronouncing .the word in the right manner go on to google and type the word and in the search right on top you'll see a little speaker icon click on that speaker.

and hear the pronunciation once or twice.
