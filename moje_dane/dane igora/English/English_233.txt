so this is a great way to practice where were we again if you're in the middle of a conversation?

and you didn't get what the other person was saying you can say you were saying and with a question mark.

which means which prompts the person to repeat once again?

you were saying .if somebody got a job of his dreams of whatever you can say lucky you or somebody got into the university of their dreams like lucky you this is a way of congratulating the person lucky you or like just emphasizing that he's lucky lucky you another way to say that you're really angry is to say i freaked out like i was so angry i .freaked out this is super angry.

oh, this is like almost crazy.
