The connections between artificial neurons are called "edges".

Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds.

The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection.

Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold.

Typically, artificial neurons are aggregated into layers.
