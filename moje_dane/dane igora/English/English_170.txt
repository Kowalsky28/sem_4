As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email.

Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are.

It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.

Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs, and find structure in the data, like grouping or clustering of data points.

The algorithms, therefore, learn from test data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized.
