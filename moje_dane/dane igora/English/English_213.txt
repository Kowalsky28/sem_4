to be stunned so stupendous is used to describe something that is stunningly good for example she looks stupendous in that dress or what a stupendous view from this balcony or i'm reading this stupendous book that i can't put down how about you go and tell.

your friends that is this stupendous channel for students and some other words that you can use instead of stupendous are incredible fantastic or exceptionally good ok so before we continue with the balanced five words on this video remember to put a comment under this video.

to tell me which of these ten words was your favorite smart word number six is in a fix in a fix means to be in a troublesome situation for example boy i'm in a fix because i've made plans with two different friends for this evening.

i've lost my phone and i'm in a fix or our bus broke down this morning and i'm in a fix my friend always turns to me for help when he's in a fix and when the going is good he forgets about.

me so the next time you get math homework from school for example and if you've left your math book in school then you can tell your friends that you're in a real fix now you may think that the word fix has something to do with repairing something.
