Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.

Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data).

Some of the training examples are missing training labels,  yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.

In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.
