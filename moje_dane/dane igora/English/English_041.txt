Because of the extent of human influence, the boundaries between what humans regard as nature and "made environments" is not clear cut except at the extremes.

Even at the extremes, the amount of natural environment that is free of discernible human influence is diminishing at an increasingly rapid pace.

The development of technology by the human race has allowed the greater exploitation of natural resources and has helped to alleviate some of the risk from natural hazards.

In spite of this progress, however, the fate of human civilization remains closely linked to changes in the environment.

There exists a highly complex feedback loop between the use of advanced technology and changes to the environment that are only slowly becoming understood.
