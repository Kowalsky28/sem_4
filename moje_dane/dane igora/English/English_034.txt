The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of yet more complex cells called eukaryotes.

[66] Cells within colonies became increasingly specialized, resulting in true multicellular organisms.

With the ozone layer absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation, life colonized the surface of Earth.

The first form of life to develop on the Earth were microbes, and they remained the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear.

[67] Microorganisms are single-celled organisms that are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see.
