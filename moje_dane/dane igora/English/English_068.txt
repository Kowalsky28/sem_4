"New pages patrol" is a process whereby newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.

[71] In 2003, economics Ph.D. student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low transaction costs of participating in a wiki create a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favor "creative construction" over "creative destruction".

[72] Any change or edit that manipulates content in a way that purposefully compromises the integrity of Wikipedia is considered vandalism.

The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor.

Vandalism can also include advertising and other types of spam.
