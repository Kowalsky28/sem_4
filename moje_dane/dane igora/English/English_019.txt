Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.

An ocean is a major body of saline water, and a principal component of the hydrosphere.

Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas.

More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep.

Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt.
