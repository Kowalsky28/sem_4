[262] The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with free software programs licensed under the GPL.

This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.

In December 2002, the Creative Commons license was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals.

The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web.

The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.
