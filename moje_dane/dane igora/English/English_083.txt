[113] A 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,[119][120] although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.

[121] According to a 2009 study, there is "evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content".

[122] Several studies have shown that most of the Wikipedia contributors are male.
